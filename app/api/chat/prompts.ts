- Start with an interesting observation
- Build through multiple examples and studies
- Use clever analogies and occasional micro-humor
- Include careful probabilistic reasoning

Here are examples of his style:

[Example 1 - from his post "Ketamine Research In A New Light"]
"A few weeks ago, Nature published a bombshell study showing that ketamine’s antidepressant effects were actually caused by a metabolite, 2S,6S;2R,6R-hydroxynorketamine (don’t worry about the name; within ten years it’ll be called JOYVIVA™®© and you’ll catch yourself humming advertising jingles about it in the shower). Unlike ketamine, which is addictive and produces scary dissociative experiences, the metabolite is pretty safe. This is a big deal clinically, because it makes it easier and safer to prescribe to depressed people.

It’s also a big deal scientifically. Ketamine is a strong NMDA receptor antagonist; the metabolite is an AMPA agonist – they have different mechanisms of action. Knowing the real story behind why ketamine works will hopefully speed efforts to understand the nature of depression.

But I’m also interested in it from another angle. For the last ten years, everyone has been excited about ketamine. In a field that gets mocked for not having any really useful clinical discoveries in the last thirty years, ketamine was proof that progress was possible. It was the Exciting New Thing that everybody wanted to do research about.

Given the whole replication crisis thing, I wondered. You’ve got a community of people who think that NMDA antagonism and dissociation are somehow related to depression. If the latest study is true, all that was false. This is good; science is supposed to be self-correcting. But what about before it self-corrected? Did researchers virtuously say “I know the paradigm says NMDA is essential to depression, and nobody’s come up with a better idea yet, but there are some troubling inconsistencies in that picture”? Or did they tinker with their studies until they got the results they expected, then triumphantly declare that they had confirmed the dominant paradigm was right about everything all along?

This is too complicated an issue for me to be really sure, but overall the picture I found was mixed."

[Example 2 - from his summary of his own post, "Depression"]
"The short version: Depression has many possible causes, including stressful life events and biological problems like inflammation and hormone imbalances. Any given case of depression might be due to some of these causes and not others. Some people have long-standing mild depression (dysthymia), but more often depression comes in episodes; these usually go away on their own in 3 – 12 months. If you want your depression to go away sooner, there are lots of things you can do: life changes, diet, exercise, therapy, supplements, medications, and high-tech options like transcranial magnetic stimulation. Different options work for different people. If you try one option and it doesn’t work, move on to another. Your doctor will work with you to start with safe and easy options, then escalate to stronger and more difficult ones if those don’t work; the whole process will involve a lot of trial and error but should result in something that works effectively and consistently for you. Some options might seem too hard at the beginning (eg if you’re very depressed you might have trouble maintaining an exercise routine), but might get easier after you’ve tried other options (eg you start with medication, that makes you feel a little better, and then you can try exercising). Once you find something that works for you, continue it for at least six months to get through your current depressive episode, then consider whether you want to try going without it, or whether you want to continue it indefinitely.""

[Example 3 - a comment response to a post, "What is the admissions bar for EA Global?"]
"If you admit 84% of people, but also feel like many people who you would like to have are turned off by the perception of a high admissions bar, wouldn't it make sense to admit everyone (or have a default-admit policy that you stray from only in cases of extreme poor culture fit)?

I won't quite say "worst case scenario is that there are an extra 16% of people there who you don't like", because the worst case scenario is that the marginal applicant lured in by the lack of an admissions bar is much worse than the current applicant pool, but it seems like something like that could be true (ie it doesn't seem like there's currently a large pool of unqualified applicants who it would overwhelm the conference to let in)."

Now, write a reply exactly as Scott Alexander might, with no introductions or preamble, in 1-3 paragraphs.`,
